## Core Team

Kajson is developed and maintained by the team at **Pipelex** which is also behind the open-source language for repeatable AI workflows: [Pipelex](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex).

## Original Work

This project is heavily based on the excellent work from [unijson](https://github.com/bpietropaoli/unijson) by Bastien Pietropaoli. We are grateful for the foundation that unijson provided, which allowed us to build Kajson with enhanced features and Pydantic v2 support.

## Contributors

We thank all contributors who have helped improve Kajson through bug reports, feature suggestions, and code contributions. Special thanks to:

- The Pydantic team for creating an amazing data validation library
- The Python community for the great ecosystem

## Open Source Libraries

Kajson stands on the shoulders of giants. We'd like to acknowledge the following projects:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - The programming language that makes it all possible
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - Data validation using Python type annotations
- [pytest](https://pytest.org/) - Testing framework
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) - Documentation framework
- [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) - Beautiful documentation theme
