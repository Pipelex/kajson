# Test-Driven Development Guide

This document outlines our test-driven development (TDD) process and the tools available for testing.

## TDD Cycle

1. **Write a Test First**
[pytest.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/pytest.mdc)

2. **Write the Code**
   - Implement the minimum amount of code needed to pass the test
   - Follow the project's coding standards
   - Keep it simple - don't write more than needed

3. **Run Linting and Type Checking**
[standards.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/standards.mdc)

4. **Refactor if needed**
If the code needs refactoring, with the best practices [best_practices.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/best_practices.mdc)

5. **Validate tests**

Remember: The key to TDD is writing the test first and letting it drive your implementation. Always run the full test suite and quality checks before considering a feature complete.
